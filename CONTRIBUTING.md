# Contributing to **devspace-AI**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **devspace-AI**. This project
is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3).

We use a simple Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) workflow for
contributions. By contributing you agree that you have the right to
submit the contribution under the project's license.

## Sign your commits (DCO)

To sign-off on a commit locally, use (recommended sign-off):

```bash
git commit -s -m "Describe your change"
```

That adds a `Signed-off-by:` line to your commit message with your name
and email. Example sign-off for this project:

```
Signed-off-by: **JFG Goutero**n <punkyard@grrlz.net>
```

If you prefer using a GUI or web-based workflow, add a comment with a
`Signed-off-by: **JFG Gouteron** <punkyard@grrlz.net>` line to the
top-level commit message in the PR description or include your own
equivalent DCO sign-off.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] follow the repository style and run tests (if any)
- [ ] include a short description of the change
- [ ] include `Signed-off-by:` DCO line in commits

## Reporting issues

Please open an issue describing the problem and steps to reproduce.
Include platform and environment notes where relevant.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This project does not currently require a CLA. If that changes, we will
document how to sign it here. For now, the DCO is sufficient for most
contributions.

## License note

By contributing, you accept that your contribution will be licensed
under the AGPLv3 (or later) along with the rest of this repository.
